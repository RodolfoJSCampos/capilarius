# Database

This folder will exclusively contain all files related to the database building, 
such as schema definitions, migration scripts, and seed data. By segregating these components, it becomes easier to manage 
and update the database independently from the rest of the application code, ensuring better collaboration among team 
members and reducing the risk of conflicts or errors during development. This approach also facilitates version control 
and enhances the overall maintainability of the project.
